### Production Line Simulation with CODESYS and Factory I/O
This project demonstrates a complete simulation of a production line using CODESYS and Factory I/O. Using Ladder logic, I created an OPC UA server to interact with the 3D industrial simulation provided by Factory I/O.

In the simulation, various components such as conveyors, robotic arms, and boxes were integrated, recreating a realistic production line environment. The control of these components was entirely implemented in Ladder logic, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of this language in industrial applications.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for those who want to understand the integration of industrial automation systems with virtual simulations, as well as providing a practical example of how to use CODESYS in conjunction with Factory I/O.
